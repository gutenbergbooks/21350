<p>The Rev. Dr. Goodford, the present Provost of Eton, has most kindly
afforded me interesting information obtained by him from the MS. records
of the College; viz., the Audit Rolls and the Bursar’s Books, respecting
Udall’s connection with Eton.</p>

<p>The salary of the Master at Eton was then £10 a year, or fifty
shillings for each of the four terms. In addition, he received 20s. for
his ‘livery,’ and other small sums, as for obits (<i>i.e.</i> attending
masses for the dead) [<i>e.g.</i> Udall received for obits, 14s. 8d. in
1535, and the same in 1536]; and for candles and ink for the boys
[<i>e.g.</i> Udall received for these purposes, 23s. 4d. in 1537, and
the same in 1538.] If the assumed multiple of 13 truly express the
relatively greater purchasing power of gold and silver more then than
now: the salary and emoluments cannot be considered excessive.</p>

<p>Udall’s name occurs in the Records spelt indifferently Woddall,
Woodall or Udall. His name first appears in 26 Henry VIII., 1534, when
his predecessor Dr. Richard Coxe was paid salary for three terms, and
Udall received 50s. for the fourth, his first term. The payments
continue on regularly so far as the books are extant, up to 1541. The
Records for 1542 are missing. It was in March 1543 that occurred the
robbery of silver images and other plate by two Eton scholars,
J.&nbsp;Hoorde and T.&nbsp;Cheney, connived at by Udall’s servant
Gregory, which resulted in Udall’s losing his place.</p>

<p>In his <i>Pref.</i> to <i>John</i>, partly translated by Princess
Mary, partly by Rev. F.&nbsp;Malet, D.D.; Udall gives us the following
account of female education in his day: which can only, however, apply
to a few women, like Elizabeth, Mary, and Lady Jane Grey. ‘But nowe in
this gracious and blisseful tyme of knowledge, in whiche it hath pleased
almightye God to reuele and shewe abrode the lyght of his moste holye
ghospell: what a noumbre is there of noble women (especially here in
this realme of Englande,) yea and howe many in the yeares of tender
vyrginitiee, not only aswel seen and as familiarly trade in the Latine
and Greke tounges, as in theyr owne mother language: but also both in
all kindes of prophane litterature, and liberall artes, exactely studied
and exercised, and in the holy Scriptures and Theologie so ripe, that
they are able aptely cunnyngly, and with much grace eyther to indicte or
translate into the vulgare tongue, for the publique instruccion and
edifying of the vnlearned multitude.... It is nowe no newes in Englande
to see young damisels in nobles houses and in the Courtes of Princes, in
stede of cardes and other instrumentes of idle trifleyng, to haue
continually in her handes, eyther Psalmes, Omelies, and other deuoute
meditacions, or elles Paules Epistles, or some booke of holye Scripture
matiers: and as familiarlye both to reade or reason thereof in Greke,
Latine, Frenche, or Italian, as in Englishe.’</p>

Reason</i> of Roister Doister’s letter to Dame Custance.</p>

<p>The first edition of the <i>Rule of Reason</i>, 1550-1, is a very
scarce work; of which I have been unable to see a copy. The second
edition, 1552, 8vo, ‘newely corrected by <i>Thomas Wilson</i>,’ has
<i>not</i> the quotation: which apparently first appears in the third
edition of 1553, 4to, the title of which runs, “The Rule of Reason,
conteinyng the Arte of <i>Logique</i>. Sette furthe in Englishe, and
newly corrected by Thomas Wilson. <i>Anno Domini. M.D.LIII.</i> Mense
Ianuarij.”</p>

<p>At folio 66 of this edition, Wilson, in treating of <i>The
Ambiguitie</i>, adds to his previous examples, Roister Doister’s letter,
with the following heading:</p>

<h6>¶ An example of soche doubtful writing, whiche by reason of<br>
poincting maie haue double sense, and contrarie<br>
meaning, taken out of an entrelude<br>
made by Nicolas Vdal.</h6>

<p>The present comedy was therefore undoubtedly written before the close
of the reign of Edward VI., who died 6&nbsp;July 1553.</p>

<p>If it was then printed, that entire edition has perished. The prayer
for the Queen at <i>p.</i>&nbsp;86, can be for no other than Queen
Elizabeth: and therefore, although the title-page is wanting and there
is no conclusive allusion in the play, it may confidently be believed
that the extant text was printed in Elizabeth’s reign: and that it had
possibly in some respects been modified.</p>

by Mr. Collier, <i>Extracts</i>, <i>i. 154</i>, <i>Ed. 1848</i>:</p>

<p class = "clear">
The missing title-page and the absence of any colophon in the Eton copy,
here reprinted, preclude demonstrative proof that it is one of Hackett’s
edition. It is however morally certain that it does represent that
text.</p>

<p>On the whole, therefore, though that text was posthumous&mdash;
<span class = "pagenum">6</span>
Udall having died in Dec. 1556&mdash;: and though its authorship rests
entirely on the above heading of Wilson’s quotation: it may be safely
accepted that Udall is the author of this comedy, and that he wrote it
before 1553. Conclusions both of them consonant with the known facts of
Udall’s life.</p>

<p>The comedy was probably first written for the Eton boys to act. Mr.
W.&nbsp;D. Cooper thus writes:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "smaller">
Certain, however, it is that it was the custom of Eton, about the feast
of St. Andrew, for the Master to choose some Latin stage-play for the
boys to act in the following Christmas holidays, and that he might
sometimes order smart and witty English plays. “Among the writings of
Udall about the year 1540,” says Warton, “are recited <i>Plures
Comediæ</i>, and a tragedy <i>De Papatu</i>, on the Papacy, written
probably to be acted by his scholars;” and it is equally probable that
the English comedy was written with a like object; for it is admirably
adapted to be a good acting play, and the author avows in the prologue
that his models were Plautus and Terence, with whose writings his
scholars were familiar.</p>

<p>Of the few dramatic pieces of that early period that have survived,
<i>Roister Doister</i> is regarded as the transition-play from the
Mysteries and Enterludes of the Middle Ages to the Comedies of modern
times. A&nbsp;critical examination of its position in our Literature has
been made by Mr. Collier. <i>Hist. of Dram. Poetry. ii. 445-460 Ed.
1830</i>. A&nbsp;full consideration of the play would exceed our present
limits: we may however call attention to the peculiar rhyme in which
Udall wrote&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>In the present reprint, the text appears according to modern usage:
but in the original it stands in lines of unvarying length. Where the
speech is continuous, these lines rhyme like our ordinary poetry: but
when the dialogue is short; one, two, three or more speeches are thrown
into one line, and the last syllables of that line&mdash;whether they
occur in words in the middle or at the end of a sentence, as dictated
simply by the length of line of type&mdash;are made to rough rhyme in
couplets. Thus an irregular assonance jingles through the play.</p>

<p>On the opposite page are a few lines set up as in the original, to
illustrate this peculiarity; and also to show the mode used of marking
the actor’s names. May this peculiar rhyme be accepted as any evidence
that Udall composed this play as much for the press as the stage?</p>

<p>There being no description of the representation and the stage
directions being scanty: <i>Roister Doister</i> should be read a first
time to learn the plot; a&nbsp;second time to imagine the action: and a
third to combine and enjoy the two.</p>

an old Etonian, in 1818, became the possessor of the now famous unique

Logic,” printed by Richard Grafton 1551&mdash;from which I ascertained
the not unimportant facts that “Ralph Roister Doister” was an older play
than “Gammer Gurton’s Needle,” and that it had been written by Nicholas
Udall, Master of Eton School: I&nbsp;thus learned who was the author of
the earliest comedy, properly so called, in our language. This was my
first literary discovery, made several years anterior, although I had
not occasion to render it public, until I printed my Notes upon
“Dodsley’s Old Plays,” soon after 1820.’*</p>

most persons. It is to the most courteous and generous kindness of the
present Provost and Fellows of Eton College that I am enabled to place
what I hope may prove an exact text into the hands of every one.
I&nbsp;trust also to keep it perpetually on sale: that the student of
the History of our Literature may no longer lack one of the most
important illustrations of the growth of English Dramatic Poesy.</p>

inevitable cessation in the issue of new works ensued: but with the
appearance of Howell’s <i>Instructions, &amp;c.</i>, the Series resumes
its growth.</p>

<p>A few changes have been made as to works in immediate preparation.
(1)&nbsp;<i>Roister Doister</i> can be published for Sixpence.
(2)&nbsp;An early printed rarity, <i>The Revelation to the Monk of

<i>Palladis Tamia</i>, 1598.</p>

<p class = "smaller">

pastorall....’ &mdash;<i>p. 284</i>,&nbsp;a.</p>

<p>There is, however, further gratulation in that
S.&nbsp;Christie-Miller, Esq. has generously consented to the printing
of Watson’s <i>The Tears of Fancy</i>, the unique copy of which forms
one of the gems of his remarkable collection at Britwell. Altogether,
therefore, the Reprint will include above 150 Sonnets, besides the
Latin-English elegy <i>Melibœus</i>.</p>

<p>The temporary loan of original editions greatly facilitates the work.
Gentlemen who may be willing so to trust the Editor are requested to
communicate with him a considerable time in advance of date of
publication.</p>

<p>The Series will continue perpetually on sale. Profit is sacrificed to
cheapness: and cheapness aimed at, in order that purchasers may acquire
not a few works simply, but the entire series. Every endeavour is made
that the selection shall be <i>representative</i> of the national
literature, as well as varied and interesting in itself: while
scrupulous care is bestowed upon each book. It may not therefore be
presumption to bespeak unceasing co-operation on the part of all readers
of English.</p>

<p>The Large Paper edition will be continued in the autumn.</p>

<h5>In succession Master of Eton College, Rector of Braintree, Prebend
of Windsor, Rector of Calborne, and Master of Westminster School.</h5>

<h5>* Probable or approximate dates.</h5>

<p>There are materials extant for a good <i>Life</i> of Udall. Meanwhile
there is Mr. Cooper’s excellent <i>Memoir</i> in the <i>Shakespeare
Society’s</i> reprint of <i>Ralph Roister Doister</i> [<i>see</i> No.
<b>5</b> <i>on p. 8</i>]; and Anthony à-Wood’s account of him, <i>Ath.
Oxon. i.&nbsp;211. Ed. 1813</i>.</p>

<p><b>1485. Aug. 22. Henry VII. becomes king.</b></p>

<p>*1504. Nicholas Udall ... was born in Hampshire, and descended from
those of his name, living sometimes at Wykeham in the same
county.&mdash;<i>Wood</i>.</p>

<p><b>1509. April 22. Henry VIII. begins to reign.</b></p>

<p>1520. June 18. æt. 14. Admitted scholar of Corpus Christi College,
Oxford.</p>
<p>1524. May 30. æt. 18. Takes his B.A. [<i>Wood, Fasti Oxon.,
i.&nbsp;65, Ed. 1815.</i>]</p>
<p>&mdash; Sept. 3. Elected Probationer Fellow of his College.</p>
<p>1533. May. Whitsun Eve. æt. 27. <i>Royal MS. 18 A. lxiv. p. 275</i>,
has two titles. (1.)&nbsp;Versis and dities made at the coronation of
queen Anne. (2.)&nbsp;Hereafter ensuethe a copie of diuers and sundry
verses aswell in latin as in Englishe deuised and made partely by Iohn
leland and partely by Nicholas Vuedale whereof sum were sette vp and sum
were spoken and pronounced vnto the most high and excellente Quene the
ladie Anne, wif vnto our sourain lorde King Henry the eight in many
goodly and costely pageauntes exhibited and shewed by the mayre and
citizens of the famous citie of london at first tyme as hir grace rode
from the Towre of London through the said citie to hir most glorious
coronation at the monasterie of Westminster on Whitson yeue in th
xxv<sup>th</sup> yere of the raigne of our said soueraigne lorde.</p>

<p>The Rev. Dr. Goodford, the present Provost of Eton, has most kindly
afforded me interesting information obtained by him from the MS. records
of the College; viz., the Audit Rolls and the Bursar’s Books, respecting
Udall’s connection with Eton.</p>

<p>The salary of the Master at Eton was then £10 a year, or fifty
shillings for each of the four terms. In addition, he received 20s. for
his ‘livery,’ and other small sums, as for obits (<i>i.e.</i> attending
masses for the dead) [<i>e.g.</i> Udall received for obits, 14s. 8d. in
1535, and the same in 1536]; and for candles and ink for the boys
[<i>e.g.</i> Udall received for these purposes, 23s. 4d. in 1537, and
the same in 1538.] If the assumed multiple of 13 truly express the
relatively greater purchasing power of gold and silver more then than
now: the salary and emoluments cannot be considered excessive.</p>

<p>1534. June 19. Udall takes his M.A. [<i>Wood, Fasti.,
i.&nbsp;98.</i>]</p>

<p>1534-1543. æt. Udall’s name occurs in the Records spelt indifferently
Woddall, Woodall or Udall. His name first appears in 26 Henry VIII.,
1534, when his predecessor Dr. Richard Coxe was paid salary for three
terms, and Udall received 50s. for the fourth, his first term. The
payments continue on regularly so far as the books are extant, up to
1541. The Records for 1542 are missing. It was in March 1543 that
occurred the robbery of silver images and other plate by two Eton
scholars, J.&nbsp;Hoorde and T.&nbsp;Cheney, connived at by Udall’s
servant Gregory, which resulted in Udall’s losing his place.</p>

<p>‘Thomas Tusser, gentleman,’ in <i>The Author’s Life</i> added to his
<i>Fiue hundreth points of good husbandrie</i>, 1573, 4to, thus writes,
but without giving any date, of Udall’s use of the rod:</p>

<p><b>Nicholas Vdal schole master at Eton.</b></p>

<div class = "poem">
<p class = "inset">From Powles I went, to Aeton sent,</p>

<p>It came to passe, thus beat I was,</p>

</div>

<p>1537. Sept. 27. Is made Vicar of Braintree. <i>Newcourt, Rep.
ii.&nbsp;89.</i></p>

<p>1542. Udall publishes a translation of the 3rd and 4th books of
Erasmus’ <i>Apophthegms</i>.</p>

<p>*1543. <i>Cott. MS. Titus, B. viii. p.&nbsp;371</i>, is a long
letter, undated and unaddressed, to some one, as to ‘my restitution to
the roume of Scholemaister in Eton.’</p>

<p>1544. Dec. 14. Resigns the Vicarship of Braintree. <i>Newcourt,
idem.</i></p>
<p>1542-1545. He is engaged with the Princess, afterwards Queen Mary and
others in translating Erasmus’ <i>Paraphrase of the New Testament</i>
into English.</p>

<p>‘1545, Sept. 30, at London,’ date of his <i>Preface to Lake</i>.</p>

<p>In his <i>Pref.</i> to <i>John</i>, partly translated by Princess
Mary, partly by Rev. F.&nbsp;Malet, D.D.; Udall gives us the following
account of female education in his day: which can only, however, apply
to a few women, like Elizabeth, Mary, and Lady Jane Grey. ‘But nowe in
this gracious and blisseful tyme of knowledge, in whiche it hath pleased
almightye God to reuele and shewe abrode the lyght of his moste holye
ghospell: what a noumbre is there of noble women (especially here in
this realme of Englande,) yea and howe many in the yeares of tender
vyrginitiee, not only aswel seen and as familiarly trade in the Latine
and Greke tounges, as in theyr owne mother language: but also both in
all kindes of prophane litterature, and liberall artes, exactely studied
and exercised, and in the holy Scriptures and Theologie so ripe, that
they are able aptely cunnyngly, and with much grace eyther to indicte or
translate into the vulgare tongue, for the publique instruccion and
edifying of the vnlearned multitude.... It is nowe no newes in Englande
to see young damisels in nobles houses and in the Courtes of Princes, in
stede of cardes and other instrumentes of idle trifleyng, to haue
continually in her handes, eyther Psalmes, Omelies, and other deuoute
meditacions, or elles Paules Epistles, or some booke of holye Scripture
matiers: and as familiarlye both to reade or reason thereof in Greke,
Latine, Frenche, or Italian, as in Englishe.’</p>

<p><b>1547. Jan. 28. Edward VI. ascends the throne.</b></p>

<p>‘1552. July 20. At Windsor.’ The date of Udall’s preface to the
translation by himself and others, of T.&nbsp;Gemini’s
<i>Anatomy</i>.</p>

<p><b>1553. July 6. Mary succeeds to the crown.</b></p>

<p>1554. Dec. 3. Date of a warrant dormer from the Queen to the Master
of her Revels. [Reprinted in <i>The Loseley MSS.</i> Ed. by <span class
= "smallcaps">A.&nbsp;J. Kempe</span>, F.S.A. London. 1836.] The warrant
runs thus&mdash;’Whereas our wellbeloued Nicholas Udall hath at soondrie
seasons convenient heretofore shewed and myndeth hereafter to shewe his
diligence in setting foorth of Dialogues and Enterludes before us fo’
ou’ regell disporte and recreacion.’ ... And then goes on to authorize
the loan of apparel for those purposes. Did the popularity of the
Dramatist, and her personal acquaintance with him, since they had worked
together on Erasmus’ <i>Paraphrase</i>, lead the Queen to condone the
intense Protestantism of the Preacher, even to the continuing of him in
favour? Udall and Ascham, two noted Protestants, are both favoured by
Mary.</p>

<p>*1555-1556. Nov. Udall is appointed Master of Westminster School, and
so continues until Mary re-establishes the Monastery at Westminster.</p>

<p>1556. Dec. Udall dies.</p>
<p>&mdash; 23. He is buried in St. Margaret’s, Westminster. <i>Cooper,
as above.</i></p>

<p>The whole of Udall’s plays were supposed to have perished [see
<i>Wood. Ath. Oxon. i.&nbsp;213</i>, Ed. 1813]. The Rev. T.&nbsp;Briggs,
an old Etonian, in 1818, became the possessor of the now famous unique
copy: which he presented to the Library of Eton College, in December of
that year.</p>

<p><b>1.</b> [?1566.] Lond. 1 vol. 4to.<br>
? First edition of a revised text. The copy, now at Eton College,
consists of 33 folios. The title-page is wanting.</p>

<p><b>2.</b> 1818. Lond. 1 vol. 8vo.<br>
‘<i>Ralph Royster Doyster</i>, A Comedy. London. Reprinted in the year
1818.’ [Ed. and privately printed by Rev. <span class =
"smallcaps">T.&nbsp;Briggs</span>. 30 copies only struck off. The
printer was James Compton, Middle St., Cloth Fair, London.] At the
beginning is the following <i>Advertisement</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘It appears from the Biographia Dramatica, that a Play called <i>Rauf
Ruster Duster</i> was entered on the books of the Stationers’ Company in
the year 1566, but that it was supposed never to have been printed:
this, however, is now proved to be a mistake, a&nbsp;copy having been
found contained in a collection of plays which was lately upon sale in
London. It is true that the name is spelt somewhat differently, but it
is presumed there can be no doubt of its being the piece in question.
The book unfortunately wants the title-page, and the author’s name is
not known. It is now in the Library of Eton College, and is here
reprinted for the amusement of the reader.’</p>

<p><b>3.</b> 1821. Lond. 1 vol. 8vo.<br>
‘<i>Ralph Royster Doyster</i>, a Comedy, entered on the books of the
Stationers’ Company, 1566. London: Printed by F.&nbsp;Marshall, Kenton
St., Brunswick Sq., 1821.’ [Editor not known.]</p>

<p>R. Southey’s copy, with his autograph, and dated 1 Feb. 1837, is in
the British Museum. Press-mark, 1344-k.</p>

<p>Neither of the above knew that Udall was the author. The editor of
1821 reprint writes, ‘The author, whoever he was,’ <i>p.</i> iv. It was
Mr. Collier who connected Wilson’s quotation with <i>Roister
Doister</i>, and so proved Udall to be its author. Writing on 14th April
1865; he thus begins the <i>Preface</i> of his <i>Bibl. Account of Ear.
Eng. Lit.</i> Ed. 1865.</p>

<p>‘During my whole life, now rapidly approaching fourscore, I&nbsp;have
been a diligent reader, and, as far as my means would allow,
a&nbsp;greedy purchaser of all works connected with early English
literature. It is nearly sixty years since I became possessed of my
first really valuable old book of this kind&mdash;Wilson’s “Art of
Logic,” printed by Richard Grafton 1551&mdash;from which I ascertained
the not unimportant facts that “Ralph Roister Doister” was an older play
than “Gammer Gurton’s Needle,” and that it had been written by Nicholas
Udall, Master of Eton School: I&nbsp;thus learned who was the author of
the earliest comedy, properly so called, in our language. This was my
first literary discovery, made several years anterior, although I had
not occasion to render it public, until I printed my Notes upon
“Dodsley’s Old Plays,” soon after 1820.’*</p>

I&nbsp;trust also to keep it perpetually on sale: that the student of
the History of our Literature may no longer lack one of the most
important illustrations of the growth of English Dramatic Poesy.</p>
